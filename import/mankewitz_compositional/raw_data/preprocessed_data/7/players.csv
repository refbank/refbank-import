My partner on this game firstly didn't read the instructions correctly, secondly doesn't speak english coherently. thirdly was replying very slowly, fourthly has stopped replying mid-game completely

This means my game will take a minimum of 64 minutes (1 minute per round, 64 questions).  I'm currently more than 20 minutes in and no longer receiving responses 

Please can you look into it and make sure they don't get compensated? Thanks",bachelor
