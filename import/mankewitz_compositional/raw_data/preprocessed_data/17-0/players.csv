Resort to non-standard nomenclature when this could add clarity.

Embrace partner's use of different nomenclature to mine, rather than enforcing a standard.

Due to lag, send only one message per turn.","Yes.

We ""clicked"", even though we phrased things our own way, and improvised at times.","I'm sorry, but the technical problems on this were major.

Sometimes, when I was director, I would see the black square. I would correctly direct the matcher. The matcher would select the correct shape. And then the square would turn RED instead of green, and we would lose the point, completely unfairly, due to this bug. I captured video recording of this on phone to provide evidence.
