We started using specific words to refer to kinds of shapes and we would start using each other's words. For example, ""horizontally symmetrical"", ""mouth"", ""claw/hook"", ""triangles"", and... ""DOGGY"", etc. I also tried asking my partner if there's anything we can do to change our strategy, but it seems like we were pretty satisfied with the strategy of just describing the shape and negative space, using specific terminology. We would be supportive of each other and apologize. but also positively reaffirm each other. I think this helped with our strategy.","I enjoyed playing with my partner! We had a fun time, and it's always more fun when we win and work together well.","Sometimes, it would be really slow to react when clicking, which was frustrating.",bachelor,NA

If I can put out 4 of my own descriptions, then my partner will need to use only 1 word  (d) I tried to incorporate the language styles of my partner. I noticed they were more comfortable when I described something in geometric shapes rather than an abstract description. I noticed my partner did the same when they picked up on my M reference. (e) Try to stay consistent. Bad descriptions can be learned if they are consistent. ",Very much because I could tell from their clues that they were making a fair effort to incorporate my language just as I was trying to incorporate their language. There was a clear effort to make a fair go at it. ,"(a) The timeout needs extending for the duration that an incorrect selection is shown on the director's screen. It seemed like the incorrect selection was only visible for a small fraction of a second. Switching to a background color highlighting instead of outline would make it more easily identified if the timing cannot be modified.  (b) On my screen, each correct selection was indicated with a text note that said $0.03 was earned. I recall the instructions saying that $0.01 was the bonus for each good match. (c) The text chat window needs to have larger font size. It would help to have the left centered slower to the vertical center. The positioning is easy to lose sight of with the need to focus on the clock and images.  Good luck with the research!",bachelor,NA
